# SIH2020
This repo was build to collaborate code for the 2020 edition of Smart India Hackathon.

The following slides explain in great detail what we have built and how. 

Please note:
The blockchain needs missing node_modules.
This repo was not intensively documented since more than an open source project, it was a way for us to collaborate on our code.
